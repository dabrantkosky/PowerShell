# PowerShell
*PipelinesToDelete* - Added powershell script that checks if pipelines and releases are not deployed in the past 2 months, if they are paused or disabled, or if they have a pass rate of less than 70% and generates an Excel sheet which you can then format in Excel: 
- Highlight the column that contains your list. 
- Go to Data > Text to Columns. 
- Choose Delimited. Click Next. 
- Choose Comma. Click Finish.
